ExpressionQuery.help = Evaluates a Java expression in the context of the given object or objects, using a holographic JVM.
ExpressionQuery.objects.help = The objects to evaluate the expression on.
ExpressionQuery.maxObjects.help = If set, limits the number of input objects.

producing a list of values. \n\
If true, the expression will be evaluated once with "this" \
bound to the set of input objects as a java.util.Collection, producing a single value. 
ExpressionQuery.inbound.help = When an object is expanded show all the objects pointing to this object, rather than \
all the objects that this object points to.

bound to the set of input objects as a java.util.Collection, producing a single value. 
LoadAndRunAnalysisCodeQuery.inbound.help = When an object is expanded show all the objects pointing to this object, rather than \
all the objects that this object points to.
