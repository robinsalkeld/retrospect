<h1>Restrospect Documentation</h1>

This document describes how to install the binary "distribution" of the retrospect project, which includes the implementation of Holographic JVMs and a version of the Eclipse Memory Analysis Tool (MAT) that has been modified to take advantage of it.
    
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
    
<h3>Requirements</h3>
    
<ul>
<li>Mac OS X
    <ul>
        <li>A couple of mirror-based native methods are UNIX file system specific. Implementing the same for other operating systems should not be difficult but I have not yet done so.</li>
        <li>The experimental setup uses a convenient trick for extracting the PID for a Java process that may not be valid for non-UNIX-like operating systems.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp?locale=en">Java 7</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-422/junosr2">Eclipse</a></li>
    <ul>
        <li>I'd recommend a fresh installation for this purpose</li>
        <li>I've tested successfully on Eclipse Classic 4.2.2, although I developed the code on Eclipse build 20110615-0604 so I expect older builds would be fine too.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
    
<ol>
    <li>Before launching Eclipse, add "-XX:-UseSplitVerifier" to the bottom of Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini
        <ol>
            <li>The newer Java 7 bytecode verifier doesn't like something in my generated bytecode. This allows the JVM to fall back to the older mechanism.</li>
        </ol>
    <li>In Eclipse, select Help | Install New Software...</li>
    <li>Click the "Add..." button to add a new software site/repository</li>
    <li>Click the "Local..." button and select the <a href="RetrospectUpdateSite">RetrospectUpdateSite</a> folder</li>
    <li>Click "OK"</li>
    <li>Uncheck "Group items by category" (otherwise nothing shows up)</li>
    <li>Select the "Retrospect" feature" and complete the installation wizard</li>
    <li>Restart Eclipse when prompted to</li>
</ol>

<h3>Rebuilding the plugins</h3>
    
If you wish, you can modify and rebuild the code yourself using Eclipse. All of the top-level folders can be imported as existing Eclipse projects. The update site can be rebuilt by right-clicking the site.xml file and selecting PDE Tools | Build Site.
<p>    
Beware that getting Eclipse installations to recognize the newer versions of the feature seems to be tricky, however - I frequently resorted to starting over with a fresh installation.
